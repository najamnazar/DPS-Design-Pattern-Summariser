observer:
Plant does not have any design pattern.  It is a public interface. The 3 methods of Plant are getWeight (int), getHeight (int) and getType (FlowerType). No methods call getWeight and getWeight calls no methods. No methods call getHeight and getHeight calls no methods. No methods call getType and getType calls no methods.

Flower acts as a publisher for observer FlowerType, which is inherited by, which grows, which gets Memento, which sets Plant parameter of plant Memento, which tos String, which gets Name, which gets Weight, which gets Height, which gets Type, which sets FlowerType parameter of type Type, which sets int parameter of height Height, which sets int parameter of weight Weight, which gets Weight, which gets Height, which gets Type. It is a public class that extends Plant and that implements Plant. The 14 methods of Flower are growing (void), getMemento (FlowerMemento), setMemento (void), toString (String), getName (String), getWeight (int), getHeight (int), getType (FlowerType), setType (void), setHeight (void), setWeight (void), getWeight (int), getHeight (int) and getType (FlowerType). No methods call growing and growing calls 4 methods : setHeight method of class Flower, getHeight method of class Flower, getWeight method of class Flower and setWeight method of class Flower. No methods call getMemento and getMemento calls 3 methods : getHeight method of class Flower, getWeight method of class Flower and getType method of class Flower. No methods call setMemento and setMemento calls no methods. No methods call toString and toString calls 4 methods : getName method of class Flower, getHeight method of class Flower, getWeight method of class Flower and getType method of class Flower. Only one method ( toString method of class Flower ) calls getName and getName calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getWeight and getWeight calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getHeight and getHeight calls no methods. 2 methods ( toString method of class Flower and getMemento method of class Flower ) call getType and getType calls no methods. No methods call setType and setType calls no methods. Only one method ( growing method of class Flower ) calls setHeight and setHeight calls no methods. Only one method ( growing method of class Flower ) calls setWeight and setWeight calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getWeight and getWeight calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getHeight and getHeight calls no methods. 2 methods ( toString method of class Flower and getMemento method of class Flower ) call getType and getType calls no methods.

Application does not have any design pattern.  It is a public class. The only method of Application is main (void). No methods call main and main calls no methods.


abstract_factory:
Plant acts as an abstract factory for, which is inherited by Flower. It is a public interface. The 3 methods of Plant are getWeight (int), getHeight (int) and getType (FlowerType). No methods call getWeight and getWeight calls no methods. No methods call getHeight and getHeight calls no methods. No methods call getType and getType calls no methods.

Flower acts as a factory for Plant, which overrides getWeight method of Plant, getHeight method of Plant, getType method of Plant, getWeight method of Plant, getHeight method of Plant, getType method of Plant. It is a public class that extends Plant and that implements Plant. The 14 methods of Flower are growing (void), getMemento (FlowerMemento), setMemento (void), toString (String), getName (String), getWeight (int), getHeight (int), getType (FlowerType), setType (void), setHeight (void), setWeight (void), getWeight (int), getHeight (int) and getType (FlowerType). No methods call growing and growing calls 4 methods : setHeight method of class Flower, getHeight method of class Flower, getWeight method of class Flower and setWeight method of class Flower. No methods call getMemento and getMemento calls 3 methods : getHeight method of class Flower, getWeight method of class Flower and getType method of class Flower. No methods call setMemento and setMemento calls no methods. No methods call toString and toString calls 4 methods : getName method of class Flower, getHeight method of class Flower, getWeight method of class Flower and getType method of class Flower. Only one method ( toString method of class Flower ) calls getName and getName calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getWeight and getWeight calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getHeight and getHeight calls no methods. 2 methods ( toString method of class Flower and getMemento method of class Flower ) call getType and getType calls no methods. No methods call setType and setType calls no methods. Only one method ( growing method of class Flower ) calls setHeight and setHeight calls no methods. Only one method ( growing method of class Flower ) calls setWeight and setWeight calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getWeight and getWeight calls no methods. 3 methods ( toString method of class Flower, getMemento method of class Flower and growing method of class Flower ) call getHeight and getHeight calls no methods. 2 methods ( toString method of class Flower and getMemento method of class Flower ) call getType and getType calls no methods.
