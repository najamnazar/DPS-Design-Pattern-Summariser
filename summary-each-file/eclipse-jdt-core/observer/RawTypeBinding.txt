RawTypeBinding acts as an observer, which creates MethodBinding parameter of originalMethod Parameterized Method, which debugs Name, which generices Type Signature, which is TypeBinding parameter of otherType Equivalent To, which is Parameterized Type, which is Raw Type, which initializes Arguments, which readables Name, which substitutes TypeBinding parameter of originalType, which shorts Readable Name.
RawTypeBinding acts as a publisher for observer TypeBinding, which creates MethodBinding parameter of originalMethod Parameterized Method, which debugs Name, which generices Type Signature, which is TypeBinding parameter of otherType Equivalent To, which is Parameterized Type, which is Raw Type, which initializes Arguments, which readables Name, which substitutes TypeBinding parameter of originalType, which shorts Readable Name.
