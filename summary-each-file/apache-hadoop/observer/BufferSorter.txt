BufferSorter acts as a publisher for observer OutputBuffer, which is inherited by BasicTypeSorterBase, which sets Progressable parameter of reporter Progressable, which adds int parameter of recordoffset, int parameter of keyLength, int parameter of valLength Key Value, which sets OutputBuffer parameter of buffer Input Buffer, which gets Memory Utilized, which sorts, which closes.
