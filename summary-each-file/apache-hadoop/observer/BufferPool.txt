BufferPool acts as an observer, which creates New, which gets All, which acquires int parameter of blockNumber, which tries int parameter of blockNumber Acquire, which acquires int parameter of blockNumber, boolean parameter of canBlock Helper, which releases Done Blocks, which releases int parameter of blockNumber Ready Block, which distances BufferData parameter of data, int parameter of blockNumber, which releases BufferData parameter of data, which closes, which tos String, which nums Created, which nums Available, which finds int parameter of blockNumber, which cans BufferData parameter of data Release.
BufferPool acts as a publisher for observer BufferData, which is inherited by, which creates New, which gets All, which acquires int parameter of blockNumber, which tries int parameter of blockNumber Acquire, which acquires int parameter of blockNumber, boolean parameter of canBlock Helper, which releases Done Blocks, which releases int parameter of blockNumber Ready Block, which distances BufferData parameter of data, int parameter of blockNumber, which releases BufferData parameter of data, which closes, which tos String, which nums Created, which nums Available, which finds int parameter of blockNumber, which cans BufferData parameter of data Release.
