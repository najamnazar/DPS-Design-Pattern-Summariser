SortedRanges acts as an observer, which skips Range Iterator, which gets Indices Count, which gets Ranges, which adds Range parameter of range, which removes Range parameter of range, which adds long parameter of start, long parameter of end, which reads DataInput parameter of in Fields, which writes DataOutput parameter of out, which tos String, which gets Start Index, which gets End Index, which gets Length, which is Empty, which equals Object parameter of o, which hashes Code, which compares Range parameter of o To, which reads DataInput parameter of in Fields, which writes DataOutput parameter of out, which tos String, which has Next, which nexts, which does Next, which skips If In Range, which skippeds All Ranges, which removes.
