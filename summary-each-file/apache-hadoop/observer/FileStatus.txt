FileStatus acts as a publisher for observer FsPermission, which is inherited by VersionedFileStatus, OBSFileStatus, S3AFileStatus, RawFileStatus, ViewFsFileStatus, AdlFileStatus, OSSFileStatus, TaggedFileStatus, FileMetadata, LocatedFileStatus, HdfsNamedFileStatus, which attributes boolean parameter of acl, boolean parameter of crypt, boolean parameter of ec, boolean parameter of sn, which gets Len, which is File, which is Directory, which is Dir, which is Symlink, which gets Block Size, which gets Replication, which gets Modification Time, which gets Access Time, which gets Permission, which has Acl, which is Encrypted, which is Erasure Coded, which is Snapshot Enabled, which gets Owner, which gets Group, which gets Path, which sets final parameter of Path Path, which sets FsPermission parameter of permission Permission, which sets String parameter of owner Owner, which sets String parameter of group Group, which gets Symlink, which sets final parameter of Path Symlink, which compares FileStatus parameter of o To, which compares Object parameter of o To, which equals Object parameter of o, which hashes Code, which tos String, which reads DataInput parameter of in Fields, which writes DataOutput parameter of out, which validates Object.
