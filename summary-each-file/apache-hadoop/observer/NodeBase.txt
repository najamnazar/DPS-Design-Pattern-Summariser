NodeBase acts as a publisher for observer Node, which is inherited by InnerNodeImpl, which sets String parameter of name, String parameter of location, which gets Name, which gets Network Location, which sets String parameter of location Network Location, which gets Node parameter of node Path, which gets Node parameter of node Path Components, which equals Object parameter of to, which hashes Code, which tos String, which normalizes String parameter of path, which gets Parent, which sets Node parameter of parent Parent, which gets Level, which sets int parameter of level Level, which locations String parameter of location To Depth.
