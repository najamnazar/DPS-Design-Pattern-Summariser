Task acts as a publisher for observer State, which is inherited by ReduceTask, AbstractTask, MapTask, TaskImpl, CompletedTask, which gets Task Id, which gets Priority, which gets Scheduler Key, which gets Node Manager, which gets Container Id, which gets Application ID, which gets Hosts, which gets Racks, which cans NodeType parameter of type, String parameter of hostName Schedule, which starts NodeManager parameter of nodeManager, ContainerId parameter of containerId, which stops, which gets State, which sets State parameter of state State, which equals Object parameter of obj, which hashes Code.
