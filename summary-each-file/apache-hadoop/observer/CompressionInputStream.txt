CompressionInputStream acts as a publisher for observer Decompressor, which is inherited by DecompressorStream, SplitCompressionInputStream, which closes, which gets IOStatistics, which reads byte[] parameter of b, int parameter of off, int parameter of len, which resets State, which gets Pos, which seeks long parameter of pos, which seeks long parameter of targetPos To New Source, which sets Decompressor parameter of decompressor Tracked Decompressor.
