Summation acts as an observer for publisher DistSum, which is inherited by, which gets Element, which gets Steps, which gets Value, which sets double parameter of v Value, which tos String, which equals Object parameter of obj, which hashes Code, which values final parameter of String Of, which computes, which compute_modulars, which compute_montgomeries, which compares Summation parameter of that To, which combines Summation parameter of that, which remains List<T> parameter of sorted Terms, which contains Summation parameter of that, which partitions final parameter of int.
