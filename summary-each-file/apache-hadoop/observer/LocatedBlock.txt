LocatedBlock acts as a publisher for observer DatanodeInfo, which is inherited by LocatedStripedBlock, which compares DatanodeInfoWithStorage parameter of dns1, DatanodeInfoWithStorage parameter of dns2, which converts DatanodeInfo[] parameter of infos, String[] parameter of storageIDs, StorageType[] parameter of storageTypes, which gets Block Token, which sets Token<BlockTokenIdentifier> parameter of token Block Token, which gets Block, which gets Locations, which gets Storage Types, which gets Storage IDs, which updates Cached Storage Info, which moves int parameter of activeLen Provided To End, which gets Start Offset, which gets Block Size, which sets long parameter of value Start Offset, which sets boolean parameter of corrupt Corrupt, which is Corrupt, which adds DatanodeInfo parameter of loc Cached Loc, which gets Cached Locations, which tos String, which is Striped, which gets Block Type.
