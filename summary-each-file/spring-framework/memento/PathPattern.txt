PathPattern acts as a caretaker for memento Comparator, which gets Pattern String, which has Pattern Syntax, which matches PathContainer parameter of pathContainer, which matches PathContainer parameter of pathContainer And Extract, which matches PathContainer parameter of pathContainer Start Of Path, which extracts PathContainer parameter of path Path Within Pattern, which compares @Nullable parameter of PathPattern To, which combines PathPattern parameter of pattern2string, which equals @Nullable parameter of Object, which hashes Code, which tos String, which gets Score, which is Catch All, which gets Normalized Length, which gets Separator, which gets Captured Variable Count, which tos Chain String, which computes Pattern String, which gets Head Section, which concats String parameter of path1, String parameter of path2, which has @Nullable parameter of PathContainer Length, which scores PathPattern parameter of pattern By Normalized Length, which pathes PathContainer parameter of pathContainer Container Is Just Separator, which gets Uri Variables, which gets Matrix Variables, which tos String, which gets Path Matched, which gets Path Remaining, which gets Uri Variables, which gets Matrix Variables, which sets Match Allow Extra Path, which is Match Optional Trailing Separator, which sets String parameter of key, String parameter of value, MultiValueMap<String, parameter of String>, which gets Path Match Result, which is int parameter of pathIndex Separator, which pathes int parameter of pathIndex Element Value.
